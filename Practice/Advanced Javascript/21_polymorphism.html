    <!-- Polymorphism is one of the 4 pillars of object-oriented programming languages where poly means many and morphism means transforming one form into another.
      Polymorphism means the same function with different signatures is called many times. 
      It allows methods to do different things based on the object it is acting upon. -->

    <!-- method overloading(compile) :- same class inner same function name and deffent is deffent parameter.  -->
    <!-- method overrriding(runtime) :- function name will same but deffent class overrriding .  -->
