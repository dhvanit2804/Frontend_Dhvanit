<!-- 3. JavaScript Operators
Create a JavaScript program to perform the following: 
 Add, subtract, multiply, and divide two numbers using arithmetic operators. 
 Use comparison operators to check if two numbers are equal and if one 
number is greater than the other. 
 Use logical operators to check if both conditions (e.g., a > 10 and b < 5) are 
true. -->
